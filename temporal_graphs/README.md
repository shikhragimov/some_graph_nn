# Temporal Graphs

Here is code for experiments for temporal graphs.
Temporal graphs are graphs where edges have timestamps.

For more information refer 
to [reports](../reports/TemporalGraphs.md)

As an example as basis DMGI graph neural network algorithm is used.

Currently mock data is used, but in the nearest future model will use real data (also metrics will be added).

The implementation is done in pytorch.
